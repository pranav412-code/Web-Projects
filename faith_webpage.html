    <p class="aman">I am here, not only for the position, but also to grab the opportunity to be friends with everyone. And like a good friend, I promise to be transparent and honest with you about the challenges that our school faces. I will do my best to communicate with you at all times possible and keep you informed. As your friend, I will be asking your open arms to help me accomplish my visions for our First Year Department this year. No one person has all the answers or can do all the work. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Together, we must be strong and cooperate to achieve our endeavours.<br><br>
